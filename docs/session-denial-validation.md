# Independent session denial: validation gates

The logout writer and cleanup flags remain disabled in staging and production.
Reader enforcement has hosted API evidence; hosted push enforcement, writer and
cleanup interruption cases, concurrent behavior, device behavior and storage-cost
acceptance remain open. This work must not weaken the independent privacy journal
or silently treat an unknown commit as complete. Track #1 and #55.

## Scoped push verification

`deliverWebPush` and `deliverNativePush` contain the same per-delivery denial and
provider-outcome logic used by the normal queue workers. They do not claim jobs,
finish jobs or open a database connection. Their `delivery` argument must be the
session/subscription envelope returned by the corresponding jobs-role
`app.prepare_*_delivery` function under a valid job lease. A caller-provided session
ID alone does not establish subscription or notification authorization. Native
provider credentials are supplied by the normal worker's existing token path.
These are internal functions, not HTTP endpoints or new authorization bypasses.

Local acceptance covers:

- Native workerd execution with an actual local R2 binding: a canonical denial
  suppresses both web/native sends; an independent session reaches only intercepted
  provider transports. Unreadable denial authority causes retry with no send.
- Missing, conflicting, failed and late denial reads. A late read cannot authorize
  a send after its deadline has already produced an unknown result.
- Existing provider redirect/retry behavior and the unchanged normal queue path.
  Both existing SQL suites run against newly created, task-owned disposable local
  databases, including restricted-role preparation and retained SQL session rows.

These are local checks. Provider sends are intercepted; they do not prove hosted
push delivery or physical-device behavior.

Before a hosted enforcement rehearsal, prepare an owner-only manifest listing the
exact synthetic identities, sessions, subscriptions, notifications and outbox jobs,
with source/schema/provider pins and a cleanup ledger. Obtain delivery envelopes
through the real jobs-role preparation functions using only those fixture job
leases. Do not call the shared `claim_push(20)` or `claim_native_push(20)` functions
merely to obtain test work: they can select unrelated notifications.

Use a temporary authenticated operator bound to the intended environment's R2
journal, running the pinned per-delivery helpers. Intercept all provider sends and
return only aggregate outcomes/counts. Verify denied, permitted and unavailable
cases; confirm unrelated session access remains usable. Preserve uncertain writes
for read-only reconciliation. Keep canonical immutable denial objects; scope SQL
cleanup to the manifest and verify it before removing the operator. Do not enable
writer/cleanup flags from this one check: the remaining failure, concurrency,
rollback-reader, device and cost gates are separate requirements.
